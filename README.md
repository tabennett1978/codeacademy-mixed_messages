### General Information
As a first mini project within the codeacademy a small assignment was set to implement some basics of JS.
Scope was to provide a small JS script\piece of code that would randonly generate a quote for each time the JS was executed.


### Technologies Used
Javascript (for quote selection)
Markdown (for basic README.md creation - this file)


### Features
A JS app that when opened spawns a randomly selected quote for each time the app is run.


### Usage
node mixed-messages.js


### Room for Improvement
* Increase content of quote as currently very limited.
* Integrate with a simple HTML\CSS webpage (completed separately to experiment)
* A more aesthetically pleasing front end (HTML\CSS) though initial scope is simply to produce something simple where the quotes are generated to apply the basicss and then to progress with the next sections of study (HTML\CSS).
* A button to generate a new quote on demand in HTML\CSS.
* Ability to select a quote type (e.g. motivational, famous, historical, etc.)
* Ability to pull a meme from a 3rd party site and display it rather than relying on a stored selection of quotes embedded into the JS.
* Expand to include JS in the back end and a DB storing the quotes to be served up at a front end (potentially incorporating something in a simple setup (e.g. AJAX, MongoDB\PostgreSQL, etc.)
